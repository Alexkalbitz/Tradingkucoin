broken first ever contact with python and django


this thing here are the remains of my first ever contact with python

since i last touched this i had a crash on my HDD and luckily managed to save my python files 
i am uploading this as a personal backup for my code and to give anyone interested an overview of 
how my programming career started

THE STORY:
This "thing" got born out of the 2017 hype for Bitcoin 
a friend of mine (professional programmer) was already deeply involved in the crypto market and he was enthusiatic 
enough to convince me to start buying crypto currency too. 
luckily i didnt invest a high amount of my savings into crypto since my buy in point into the market was at the 
95th percentile of Bitcoins alltime high and it has gone down ever since. 

we spent nights on discords videochat and i watched him live coding alot of usefull tools we both thought would aid our 
plan to get rich quick.
webscraper
trading platform APIs
Twitter API 
database (Postgres)
different tools to visualize the collected data (mainly django)

my only programming knowledge at this point was the book "PHP f√ºr Dummies" which i bhought back 
in 2004 (read about half)and have not touched it since

not long after we started he convinced me to start programming myself instead of just watching him do all the work
so he guided my through the process of setting up all that was needed to get going

he helped me set up a django project with Pycharm Community edition (doesnt support django like the pro version does)
from then on i started to take my first steps while having him as a backup for all those stupid questions someone without any
knowledge in coding eventually needs an in depth explanation to really understand the different concepts behind python
and programming in general

so this thing here was almost exclusively written by myself but i did have alot of help when running into problems

DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT:

this is a Django Project which i used to interact with Kucoin.com API and Postgres Database 
to get the Data i wanted in the format i wanted onto a single sheet (html) to have a simple one Button (F5) 
"get all the latest information i want" thing for using this platform

it is in no way a product i would give anyone to use, but it is my first ever piece of "software" i wrote 
(and it actually had some real life usage/value)
